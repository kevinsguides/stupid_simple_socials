MOD_STUPIDSS_ICONLOADER_DESC="Where to load the icons used in the buttons from. Only applies to LinkedIn for now, as that's the only button that isn't loaded via JavaScript. If FontAwesome, it does nothing, and assumes you have a template or plugin that loads it. If SVG, it will load from the modules image folder. If none, it will show each social network name written out entirely in text instead of icons."
